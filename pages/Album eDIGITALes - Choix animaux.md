	- If humans were to go extinct, our carbon emissions could still remain in the air for a long time. *__That could lead to boom times for plants, some of which can thrive in a CO2-dense atmosphere.__* The increased density and diversity of plants, in turn, might eventually increase the concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere. Researchers have hypothesized that the growth of insects depends in part on the concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere, *__which could lead to insects developing larger bodies__*
