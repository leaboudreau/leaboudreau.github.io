- __Cuteness__ is a characteristic of an entity attributed by an observer. Cuteness is often associated with physical features such as size (small), colour (colourful), texture (fluff), sound (high-pitched), but can vary according to culture, epoch and individual preferences. It is frequently linked to anthropomorphism. Used in relation with other characteristics like aliveness and agency, cuteness can subvert its "aestheticized powerlessness" quality.
