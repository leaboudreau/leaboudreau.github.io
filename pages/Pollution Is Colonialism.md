- Introduction
	- "The structures that allow plastics' global distribution and full integration into ecosystems and everyday human lives are based on colonial land relations, the assumed access by settler and colonial projects to Indigenous lands for settler and colonial goals." (pp. 5) #colonialism #pollution
	- "I find that many people understand colonialism as a monolithic structure with roots exclusively in historical bad action, rather than as a set of contemporary and evolving land relations that can be maintained by good intentions and even good deeds. " (pp. 6) #colonialism
	- "Environmentalism often 'propagates and maintains the dispossession of Indigenous peoples for the common good of the world.'" (pp. 10)
	- "Conflating colonialism with capitalism misses crucial relations, which Coulthard argues include white supremacy and patriarchy." (pp. 14) #colonialism #capitalism #whitesupremacy #patriarchy
	- "Even though I'm sure you've heard that 'everything is related' in many Indigenous cosmologies, this doesn't mean there is a cosmic similitude of relations. You are not obliged to all things the same way." (pp. 24) #interrelations
	- "Indigenous peoples, settlers, and others have different roles and responsibilities in the 'challenge to invent, revive, and sustain decolonizing possibilities and persistences'." (pp. 25) #decolonialism
	- "I refuse to reproduce 'damage-centered research... that operates, even benevolently, from a theory of change that establishes harm or injury in order to achieve reparation' and instead work to put 'the context of racism and colonization' at the centre of pollution research. [...] looking upstream to see structures of violence rather than effects and harm." (pp. 34) #care #powerdynamics
	- "Throughout this book, I redefine pollution as central to, rather than a by-product of, colonialism, and I think about the role of science in achieving both colonialism and anticolonialism." (pp. 36) #pollution #colonialism
	- "It discusses Indigenous concepts of Land and how these ideas get flattened into Nature through colonial relations based in separation, universalism, and the scientifically proven resilience of the natural world." (pp. 36) #colonialism
- Land, Nature, Resource, Property
	- "The subjugation of land and nonhuman life to deathlike states in order to support 'human' life is a 'biopolitics' well beyond the Foucauldian conception of biopolitical as governmentality or the neoliberal disciplining of modern, bourgeois, 'human' subject." (pp. 43) #biopolitics
	- "Like many others, I struggle with the designation of nonhuman to mean everyone who isn't human since the term recentres the human at the moment you're trying not to. [...] The alternative more-than-human also leaves humans in the middle, though I appreciate its commitments." (pp. 43) #anthropocentrism #more-than-human
	- "The logical extension of quantifying the threshold of pollution was to parcel out the assimilative capacity - essentially, the ability to waste, even the right to waste - to polluters." (pp. 57) #pollution
	- "this concept of natural assimilation is the conceptual premise of climate change denial." (pp. 60) #climatechange
	- "I do this to argue against theories of change that rely on awareness as the crux of motivation for change. 'I only settlers and colonialists knew how their worldview centres themselves and their needs against others'!' [...] they understand." (pp. 63) #powerdynamics #socialchange
	- "He [Heidegger] argues that modern technology's main task is to transform and stockpile Nature as a standing reserve via enframing." (pp. 64) #technology
	- "The most important aim of recasting land as property is to make it ahistorical in order to hack away the narratives that invoke prior claims and thus reaffirm the myth of terra nullius." (pp. 68) #property #colonialism
	- "This settler commissioner, along with many of his contemporaries, thought that until Europeans arrived, most of the land was waste, or, where native people were obviously using it, that their use were inadequate.'" (pp. 72) #capitalism #colonialism #extractivism #economicgrowth
	- "I hope I've explained it so that when you're on a call with the federal government and someone says that we should set a quantifiable limit to plastics in an environment, you can know this is about enclosure, access, private property, and whiteness." (pp. 78) #whiteness #powerdynamics
- Scale, Harm, Violence, Land
	- "To be subject to anti-Indian technologies does not require you to be an Indigenous person." (pp. 81)
	- "[...] industrial pollutants like carbon dioxide or marine plastics are not discrete actors (bad or otherwise) but a set of relations." (pp. 82) #relations
	- "The way dominant science understands chemicals often operates from a colonial worldview that privileges separation and discreteness within Nature. In this worldview, the expert understands chemicals from a god-like, above-it-all, and looking-from-the-objective-outside scientific position." (pp. 83) #humansupremacy
	- "The BPA present in 91 percent of Canadians doesn't guarantee biomedical harm to Canadians. Instead, its ubiquity is better understood as violence, a manifestation of the permission-to-pollute system that allows BPA to be found in nearly all those tested. [...] Instead of defining violence as a direct event of force or coercion, the concept of structural violence 'directly illustrates a power system wherein social structures or institutions cause harm to people in a way that results in maldevelopment or deprivation... that constrains them from achieving the quality of life that would have otherwise been possible.'" (pp. 87) #violence #powerdynamics
	- "Kyle Powys Whyte (Potawatomi) argues that climate change and other forms of using Land as a sink 'systematically erase certain socioecological contexts, or horizons, that are vital for members of another society to experience themselves in the world as having responsibilities to other humans, nonhumans and the environment.'" (pp. 88) #interspeciesrelationship #powerdynamics
	- "In addition to their scales of production, the structural violence of toxicants stems from the dominance of the threshold model of pollution, which 'systematically erases certain socioecological contexts, or horizon,' that are vital for kinds of relations that are not industrial." (pp. 96) #relations
	- "If plastics and their chemicals are found in tap water, beer, the Arctic, and fetuses, then the relationships we should be looking at are not the end of the pipe, but in how plastics go into the pipe to begin with. [...] Interventions that do not address plastics production can maintain and even secure land as standing reserves for plastics." (pp. 102) #natureasresource #capital
	- "When I say rude, I mean that it erases the considerable agency of albatross. But also, the majority of the social science and humanities presentations that I have seen that include these pictures also tend to make claims about extending kinship to 'nonhumans'. They almost always mean albatross and almost never mean plastics. [...] using Indigenous (most often Cree and MÃ©tis) concepts of kin without citation." (pp. 106) #interspeciesrelationship #nonhuman
	- "In the context of these relations and obligations to Land, it makes sense to some people to eat contaminated food. The stakes of not eating the food are cultural genocide, where the languages, knowledge, and thus relations with Land are killed to the point that they are no longer reproduced by successive generations." (pp. 107)
	- "The greatest health effects [of pollution] are seen outside of chemical exposures and are thus not included in risk assessments. The environmental contamination in Akwesasne has negative impacts on the cultural, social, and physical health of the community beyond those directly related to the ingestion of fish." (pp. 108)
	- "The machine here is made from mother earth. It has a spirit of its own. This spirit probably hasn't been recognized and given the right respect that it should. When we work in a world of automated things, we forget that... everything is sacred, and that includes what we make." (pp. 109) #machine #machineagency
- An Anticolonial Pollution Science
	- "Simmonds spoke of care as an affective relation whose leading ethic is to create attachments within infrastructures of inequity. These attachments are best described as obligations." (pp. 115) #care
	- "'Practices of care are always shot through with asymmetrical power relations... Care organizes, classifies, and disciplines bodies. Colonial regimes show us precisely how care can become a mean of governance.' Care is not inherently good. It is an uneven relation and can contribute to and/or mitigate unevenness." (pp. 115) #care #powerdynamics
	- "Often I hear scholars and activists alike talking as if capitalism (or patriarchy or racism, but mostly capitalism) is a solid monolith that we must dash our soft bodies against, to little avail. But that characterization gives capitalism and colonialism more power than they merit by erasing not only their diversity, but also the patchiness, the unevenness, and the failures of those systems to fully reproduce themselves. It erases the other kinds of economies and L/land relations that happen within, alongside, and in spite of capitalism, the university, and colonialism." (pp. 130) #capitalism
	- "[D]ecolonization specifically requires the repatriation of Indigenous land and life. [...] Anticolonial sciences are characterized by _how_ they do not reproduce settler and colonial entitlement to Land and Indigenous cultures, concepts, knowledges, and life." (pp. 132) #colonialism #decolonialism #anticolonialism
