	- "[...] cetacean intelligence, self-awareness, emotionality, and social complexity mean that they, like us, experience life as persons. But they move very differently, live in an exotic milieu, lack clear facial expressions, communicate in unfamiliar modalities, and always seem to be smiling (although this is just an anatomical illusion). These differences make it challenging for humans to recognize the similarities to us and their ability to suffer like us, and, thus, make it easier to objectify and exploit them." (pp. 23)
	- "Few animals have the revenue-earning potential of dolphins and whales." (pp. 27) #capitalism
