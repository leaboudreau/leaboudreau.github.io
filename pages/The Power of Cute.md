- 08_ What’s Wrong with Cute anthropomorphism?
	- "[...] anthropomorphism is to a large extent the rhetorical strategy of children’s books" (pp. 111) #anthropomorphism
	- "The “narcissism of cuteness” therefore means that “the cute vision of the natural world is a world without nature, one that annihilates ‘otherness,’" (pp. 111) #other
	- "a dominating gesture” that can end up maiming and silencing (“denying speech” to) its objects." (pp. 112)
	- "Ngai claims that this text exemplifies how endowing a dumb object with expressive capabilities can become just such an anthropomorphizing act of domination, indeed of injury." (pp. 112) #powerdynamics
	- "Ngai appears to conclude that Cute’s “master trope”—in other words, personification of its objects—ends up manipulating and exploiting those objects, despite (or because of?) ascribing agency to them." (pp. 114)
	- "But there is another way of looking at the anthropomorphizing effect of Cute—namely, to see Cute’s power to personify its objects as precisely a way of recognizing and honoring their Otherness." (pp. 114) #anthropomorphism

	- "Here, personification becomes a way of achieving empathy rather than injury." (pp. 115) #empathy
	- "By motivating human sociality, they argue, “cute entities become objects of moral concern and members of the moral circle.” Precisely because the cuteness response anthropomorphizes, it draws others into our moral circle, pulls strangers closer, and endows them with new value." (pp. 120-121) #moral
	- "Indeed, the more unlike us others are, the more we must impute to them human feelings and human characteristics—such as vulnerability, pain, and the need for protection—in order to unleash that sense of fellow feeling. __[are those really ONLY ‘human’ feelings?]__ Anthropomorphizing, to the extent that it extends our circle of concern, therefore makes possible such empathic ac- cess to the Other. In doing so, it can jump species barriers between humans and the rest of the animal world—and between the living and the inanimate." (pp. 121) #anthropomorphism #other
	- "On the other hand, humanization can also close down our vision of others by in- deed treating them as vessels into which we narcissistically pour our own particular world—our perspectives, our values, our needs—accompanied by the implicit or explicit demand that they be like us or con- form to what we can tolerate." (pp. 123)
	- "And, more generally, whether we aren’t impoverishing our understanding of human intentions, relations, and values by framing them so doggedly in terms of the power they seek or manifest. [...] But does the power paradigm really capture more than one dimension of our relations to others? " (pp. 125) #powerdynamics
