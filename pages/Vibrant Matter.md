- Preface
	- "The quarantines of matter and life encourage us to ignore the vitality _of_ matter and the lively powers _of_ material formations [...]." #lifematter
	- "How would political responses to public problems change were we to take seriously the vitality of (nonhuman) bodies?" #nonhuman #politics #biopolitics
	- "The term is Bruno Latour's: an actant is a source of action that can be either human or nonhuman; it is that which has efficacy, can _do_ things, has sufficient coherence to make a difference, produce effects, alter the source of events." #nonhuman #actant
	- "Why advocate the vitality of matter? Because my hunch is that the image of dead or thoroughly instrumentalized matter feeds human hubris and our earth-destroying fantasies of conquest and consumption. It does so by preventing us from detecting (seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling) a fuller range of the nonhuman powers circulating around and within human bodies." #nonhuman #vitalmaterialism
	- "[...] to sketch a style of political analysis that can better account for the contributions of nonhuman actants." #nonhuman #politics
	- "[...] 'ethics' could no longer refer primarily to a set of doctrines; it had to be considered as a complex set of relays between moral contents, aesthetic-affective styles, and public moods." #affect #ethics
	- "How to describe without thereby erasing the independence of things?"
- 01_ The Force of Things
	- "In this assemblage, _objects_ appeared as _things_, that is, as vivid entities not entirely reducible to the contexts in which (human) subjects set them, never entirely exhausted by their semiotics." (pp. 5) #thing #thingpower #object
	- "It hit me then in a visceral way how American materialism, which requires buying ever-increasing numbers of products purchased in ever-shorter cycles, is _anti_ materiality. The sheer volume of commodities, and the hyperconsumptive necessity of junking them to make room for new ones, conceals the vitality of matter." (pp. 5) #capitalism #commodity√†
	- "_Thing-Power_: the curious ability of inanimate things to animate, to act, to produce effects dramatic and subtle." (pp. 6) #thingpower #actant
	- "In case of accidental death or injury to a human, the nonhuman actant, for example, the carving knife that fell into human flesh or the carriage that trampled the leg of a pedestrian - became deodand [...] the deodand, a materiality 'suspended between human and thing,' was surrendered to the crown to be used (or sold) to compensate for the harm done." (pp. 8) #agency
	- "Such a newfound attentiveness to matter and its powers will not solve the problem of human exploitation or oppression, but it can inspire a greater sense of the extent to which all bodies are kin in the sense of inextricably enmeshed in a dense network of relations." (pp. 13) #powerdynamics #relations
