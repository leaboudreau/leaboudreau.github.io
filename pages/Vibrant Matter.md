- Preface
- "The quarantines of matter and life encourage us to ignore the vitality _of_ matter and the lively powers _of_ material formations [...]." #lifematter
- "How would political responses to public problems change were we to take seriously the vitality of (nonhuman) bodies?" #nonhuman #politics #biopolitics
- "The term is Bruno Latour's: an actant is a source of action that can be either human or nonhuman; it is that which has efficacy, can _do_ things, has sufficient coherence to make a difference, produce effects, alter the source of events." #nonhuman #actant
